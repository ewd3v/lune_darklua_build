- [ ] Wait for jiwonz/glob package release to include https://github.com/jiwonz/glob-lune/pull/3 (so the current glob package can be replaced with it).
- [ ] Refactor code.
- [ ] A separate include array, for files that aren't required while building, but should be included in the output (should improve build times).
- [ ] Reduce the amount of copying and overwriting files that haven't changed.
